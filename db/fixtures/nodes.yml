        # relationships we expect ontology-contributors to use
peer_of:
  name: peer_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Peer Of (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    A relationship of this type between two nodes indicates a
    relationship between equals.  This would be appropriate, for
    example, as a description of the "synonym" relationship that might
    occur between the entries for two words in a thesaurus.
    WontoMedia makes two assumptions about individuals that have a
    Peer-Of relationship to each other.  First, the relationship is
    assumed to be bidirectional.  Saying that "A is a Peer-Of B"
    implies that "B is a Peer-Of A", and it doesn't matter which of
    the two "directions" is used when the relationship is first
    created.  Second, when showing the graph of relationships between
    individuals, WontoMedia will attempt to indicate Peer-Of
    relationships as primarily horizontal.


one_of:
  name: one_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: One Of (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    A relationship of this type between two nodes is hierarchical.
    This relationship states that the subject (left-hand side) of the
    relationship ("A" in the relationship "A is One-Of B", and like
    "macintosh" in "macintosh is One-Of computer") is assumed to be
    more specific or more narrow than the object of the relationship
    ("B" and "computer").  When showing a graph of connections
    between items, WontoMedia will attempt to indicate 'One-Of'
    relationships as primarily vertical, with the object-item drawn
    nearer "the root" of the graph and the subject-item toward "the
    leaves".

    'One Of' is most appropriate for showing relationships between an
    individual and a category.  Relationships between two categories
    are better indicated with 'Child Of', as in "computer is Child-Of
    electronics" (assuming, of course, that they're both categories).

    'One Of' is itself a child of 'Child Of'.  And 'Child Of' is the
    opposite of 'Parent Of', and finally 'Contains' is a child of
    'Parent Of'.  So, it might be possible to infer that 'One Of' and
    'Contains' are approximate opposites of each other.  However,
    making a 'One Of' relationship between two nodes will not
    automatically cause the symmetric 'Contains' relationship to be
    created.


contains:
  name: contains
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Contains (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    A relationship of this type between two nodes is hierarchical.
    This relationship states that the subject (left-hand side) of the
    relationship ("A" in the relationship "A Contains B", and like
    "spacecraft" in "spacecraft Contains apollo") is more general or
    broad than the object of the relationship ("B" and "apollo").
    When showing a graph of connections between items, WontoMedia
    will attempt to indicate 'Contains' relationships as primarily
    vertical, with the subject-item drawn nearer "the root" of the
    graph and the object-item toward "the leaves".

    'Contains' is most appropriate for showing relationships between a
    category and an individual.  Relationships between two categories
    are better indicated with 'Parent Of', as in "vehicle Contains
    spacecraft" (assuming, of course, that both are categories).

    'Contains' is actually Child-Of 'Parent Of'.  'Parent Of' and
    'Child Of' are opposites of each other, and 'One Of' is a child of
    'Child Of'.  But this does not make 'Contains' and 'Child Of'
    opposites of each other, though an approximation of opposite-ness
    could be inferred.  WontoMedia will not automatically cause a
    'Child Of' relationship to be created when a 'Contains'
    relationship is.


parent_of:
  name: parent_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Parent Of (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    This is the fundamental type of hierarchical relationship.  This
    relationship states that the subject (left-hand side) of the
    relationship ("A" in the relationship "A is the Parent-Of B", and
    like "vehicle" in "vehicle is Parent-Of spacecraft") is a
    super-set of the object of the relationship ("B" and
    "spacecraft").  When showing a graph of connections between
    items, WontoMedia will attempt to indicate 'Parent Of'
    relationships as primarily vertical, with the subject-item drawn
    nearer "the root" of the graph and the object-item toward "the
    leaves".

    'Parent Of' is typically appropriate for relationships between two
    categories or between two individuals.  To indicate that a
    category contains an individual, the more specific 'Contains' can
    be used.

    'Parent Of' is the opposite of 'Child Of'.  Creating a
    relationship that states one category is 'Parent Of' another is
    exactly the same as creating a 'Child Of' relationship with the
    subject and object reversed, and WontoMedia will list the
    relationship between then using both relationship names (which
    name is given priority depends on which node is more central to
    the display).


child_of:
  name: child_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Child Of (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    This is the fundamental type of hierarchical relationship.  This
    relationship states that the subject (left-hand side) of the
    relationship ("A" in the relationship "A is a Child-Of B", and
    like "spacecraft" in "spacecraft is Child-Of vehicle") is a subset
    of the object of the relationship ("B" and "vehicle").  When
    showing a graph of connections between items, WontoMedia will
    attempt to indicate 'Child Of' relationships as primarily
    vertical, with the object-item drawn nearer "the root" of the
    graph and the subject-item toward "the leaves".

    'Child Of' is typically appropriate for relationships between two
    categories or between two individuals.  To indicate that an
    individual is contained by a category, the more specific 'One Of'
    can be used.

    'Child Of' is the opposite of 'Parent Of'.  Creating a
    relationship that states one category is 'Child Of' another is
    exactly the same as creating a 'Parent Of' relationship with the
    subject and object reversed, and WontoMedia will list the
    relationship between then using both relationship names (which
    name is given priority depends on which node is more central to
    the display).


predecessor_of:
  name: predecessor_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Predecessor Of (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    This relationship states that the subject (left-hand side) of the
    relationship ("A" in the relationship "A is a Predecessor-Of B")
    precedes the object in some type of ordered sequence or
    collection.


successor_of:
  name: successor_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Successor Of (basic relationship)
  description: >-
    This relationship states that the subject (left-hand side) of the
    relationship ("N" in the relationship "N is a Successor-Of M")
    follows the object in some type of ordered sequence or
    collection.


        # relationships grounding those above
inverse_relationship:
  name: inverse_relationship
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Inverse Relationship (basic relationship type)
  description: >-
    This relationship is used to characterize how two other
    relationships relate to each other.  This relationship is used to
    denote that two other relationships are symmetric and inseparable
    opposites of each other.  For example, "Child-Of has
    Inverse-Relationship to Parent-Of".  WontoMedia will interpret any
    two relationships linked by 'Inverse Relationship' (or by a
    non-built in relationship that is marked as a 'SubProperty Of'
    'Inverse Relationship') as being identical antonyms of each
    other.  Any time one relationship is created, WontoMedia will
    automatically infer, create, and show the matching opposite
    (inverse) relationship's name.


sub_property_of:
  name: sub_property_of
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: SubProperty Of (basic relationship type)
  description: >-
    This relationship is used to relate two other relationships to
    each other.  The statement "A is a SubProperty-Of B" says that the
    relationship A makes a more specific, narrow claim about nodes it
    relates than the relationship B does.  However, if WontoMedia has
    special behavior or handling for relationship B, the 'SubProperty
    Of' statement allows it to determine it should apply that special
    behavior to A as well.

    For example, when drawing relationship graphs, WontoMedia attempts
    to draw all instances of 'Symmetric Relationship" in a primarily
    horizontal way.  There is a built-in statement that "Peer-Of is a
    SubProperty-Of Symmetric-Relationship", which causes 'Peer Of'
    relationships to be (preferentially) drawn horizontally, as will
    be any other types of relationships that are added to an ontology
    with WontoMedia.


        # fundamental property classes; the root of the property universe
symmetric_relationship:
  name: symmetric_relationship
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Symmetric Relationship (root relationship type)
  description: >-
    This is a root element in WontoMedia's internal schema.  All
    relationship (property) classes are children of one of three root
    relationship types, including this one.

value_relationship:
  name: value_relationship
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Value Relationship (root relationship type)
  description: >-
    This is a root element in WontoMedia's internal schema.  All
    relationship (property) classes are children of one of three root
    relationship types, including this one.

hierarchical_relationship:
  name: hierarchical_relationship
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Hierarchical Relationship (root relationship type)
  description: >-
    This is a root element in WontoMedia's internal schema.  All
    relationship (property) classes are children of one of three root
    relationship types, including this one.

ordered_relationship:
  name: ordered_relationship
  sti_type: PropertyNode
  flags: <%= Node::DATA_IS_UNALTERABLE %>
  title: Ordered Relationship (root relationship type)
  description: >-
    This is a root element in WontoMedia's internal schema.
    Properties should be made sub_property_of  this property if they
    imply an order between their subject and object.  Among other
    things, this property allows WontoMedia to make UI decisions.
