## This is WontoMedia ##

WontoMedia is a Ruby-on-Rails web app for community creation of an
information classification scheme.  WontoMedia is free software
(licensed under the AGPL v3), and is being developed by a dispersed
volunteer team using agile methods.

This README will be expanded as the project matures.  Until that time,
you can find additional, general information in the following places:

    http://wontomedia.rubyforge.org/
    http://rubyforge.org/projects/wontomedia/
    http://wiki.wontology.org/Main_Page

In particular, simple installation instuctions are on the last page
above, with more details at:

    http://wiki.wontology.org/InstallFromScratch
    http://wiki.wontology.org/SettingUpYourDevelopmentEnvironment

Once you've got WontoMedia, you can find some design and workflow
documentation in the WontoMedia source directory under the `doc`
directory.  If you run the `rake doc:app` command, RDoc documentation
will be extracted and can be viewed in a browser starting from
`doc/app/index.html`.

And if you have any questions or feedback about the projet, there are
