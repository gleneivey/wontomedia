== Welcome ==

'''Welcome''' to the wiki for the [[WontoMedia]] web application.
WontoMedia is free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS, licensed under
the [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html AGPL v3]),
being developed by a distributed/dispersed volunteer team using agile
methods.  Additional introductory information can be found
[http://wontomedia.rubyforge.org/ on the project's home page].

Eventually this wiki will also contain [[UserReference]] information
and [[SystemAdministration]] documentation, but we're still very early
in development, and are creating pages to help new developers join the
project and work with the WontoMedia software itself.

== Installing WontoMedia ==

'''To install WontoMedia for use''' on your own system, your intranet,
or publicly on the Internet, it is recommended to install the latest
release gem from our repository on [[RubyForge]]:

  gem install wontomedia

If this command is familiar to you, and you know how to update a Rails
applications' <tt>database.yml</tt>, then this should be all you need.
For more information, please see [[InstallFromScratch]] for a set of
step-by-step instructions.

'''To install WontoMedia for development''', it is better to obtain it
directly from our ''development'' repository on [[GitHub]]:

  ''cd to the directory that you want wontomedia '''below''' ''
  git clone git://github.com/gleneivey/wontomedia.git

And we have more information on [[SettingUpYourDevelopmentEnvironment]]
separately.

== Developer's References ==

Our latest source code is on GitHub (we push to the
[http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=7903 Git repository on RubyForge]
for each minor release, but not when each "user story" is done).  You
can install directly from it (see above) or
[http://github.com/gleneivey/wontomedia/tree/master use GitHub's
web-based source browser] to investigate our source.

== WontoMedia Design and Architecture ==

=== Planned Functionality ===

There are many different directions in which we can expand
[[WontoMedia]]'s functionality.  How development will proceed will be
dictated primarily by developer interest in different feature areas.
The overall planning process is centered on
[http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/article_view/27 user stories].
Middle- and long-term feature areas are defined by a collection of
[[EpicStories]] and our [[WmHelp:MajorRoadmap|major-features
roadmap]].  These stories are being incrementally defined and
decomposed into smaller, actionable stories, which we manage using
[https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/9280/stories Pivotal
Tracker].

=== Architecture ===

The following wiki pages provide information on [[WontoMedia]]'s
internal structure and operation:

* [[UserVocabulary]] &mdash; the terminology and concepts WontoMedia exposes to users and their foundations in knowledge representation
* [[KeyModels]] &mdash; the contents and relationships of the system's central Rails model objects, how they are used, and how they relate to the capabilities presented to the user
