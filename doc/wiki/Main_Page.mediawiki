== Welcome ==

'''Welcome''' to the wiki for the [[WontoMedia]] web application.  WontoMedia is free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS, licensed under the [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html AGPL v3]), being developed by a distributed/dispersed volunteer team using agile methods.  Additional introductory information can be found [http://wontomedia.rubyforge.org/ on the project's home page].

Eventually this wiki will also contain [[UserReference]] information and [[SystemAdministration]] documentation, but we're still very early in development, and are creating pages to help new developers join the project and work with the WontoMedia software itself.

== Installing WontoMedia ==

'''To install WontoMedia for use''' on your own system, your intranet, or publicly on the Internet, it is recommended to install the latest release gem from our repository on [[RubyForge]]:

  gem install wontomedia

If this command is familiar to you, and you know how to update a Rails applications' <tt>database.yml</tt>, then this should be all you need.  For more information, please see [[InstallFromScratch]] for a set of step-by-step instructions.

'''To install WontoMedia for development''', it is better to obtain it directly from our ''development'' repository on [[GitHub]]:

  ''cd to the directory that you want wontomedia '''below''' ''
  git clone git://github.com/gleneivey/wontomedia.git 

And we have more information on [[SettingUpYourDevelopmentEnvironment]] separately.

== Developer's References ==

Our latest source code is on GitHub (we push to the [http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=7903 Git repository on RubyForge] for each minor release, but not when each "user story" is done).  You can install directly from it (see above) or [http://github.com/gleneivey/wontomedia/tree/master use GitHub's web-based source browser] to investigate our source.

== WontoMedia Design and Architecture ==

=== Planned Functionality ===

There are many different directions in which we can expand [[WontoMedia]]'s functionality.  How development will proceed will be dictated primarily by developer interest in different feature areas.  The overall planning process is centered on [http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/article_view/27 user stories].  Middle- and long-term feature areas are defined by a collection of [[EpicStories]].  These stories are being incrementally defined and decomposed into smaller, actionable stories, which we manage using [https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/9280/stories Pivotal Tracker].

=== Architecture ===

The following wiki pages provide information on [[WontoMedia]]'s internal structure and operation:

* [[UserVocabulary]] &mdash; the terminology and concepts WontoMedia exposes to users and their foundations in knowledge representation
* [[KeyModels]] &mdash; the contents and relationships of the system's central Rails model objects, how they are used, and how they relate to the capabilities presented to the user
