Assuming that you [[WmHelp:Tutorials/CreatingANode|know how to create an individual node]], the next most fundamental step in learning how to enter and represent information in a [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Wontology|wontology]] is to be able to create a new [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Edge|edge]] that connects nodes and represents the [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Relationship|relationship]] they have to each other.

If you are still on the page for the node that was created in the last tutorial, you will find <tt>Add a new edge</tt> in the list of links on the page.  If not, most other pages generated by [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_WontoMedia|WontoMedia]] also contain either that link or a synonymous <tt>Create a new edge</tt> link.

Regardless of the link used, edges are created from the same form page, which contains three drop-down selection controls.  Each control is used to determine one of the three nodes that the new edge will reference, that is, the new edge's [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Subject|subject]], [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Predicate|predicate]], and [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object|object]].

For example, we will make a statement relating a node that represents an automobile with a node that represents its owner.  For this tutorial, create an edge that expresses the statement "JohnSmithsCar isOwnedBy JohnSmith" (only we'll use node names based on your name rather than the fictitious John Smith).

* First, set the edge's '''Subject''' node to be (your equivalent of) "JohnSmithsCar".  Click on the arrow at the right end of the Subject drop-down select box.
** If you have previously performed the [[WmHelp:Tutorials/CreatingANode|creating a node tutorial]] and did not delete the node that you created then, scroll through the drop-down list (which contains node [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Name|Names]] and [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Title|Titles]]) until you find the node you've previously created, and then select (click on) it.  Once you've selected a node for the Subject, the area below the drop-down control will fill in with the [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Description|Description]] of the node you chose.
** Each of the three drop-down selection controls contains an entry near the top that says "-create a new ___ for this ___-", where the blanks say different things for each of the three different controls.  If you select this entry, a new node creation form will be displayed in a pop-up over the edge creation form.  This form is the same as the one described in the [[WmHelp:Tutorials/CreatingANode|node creation tutorial]], except that it doesn't contain the text that describes the different node types.  Nodes that you create during edge creation during the pop-up are "full fledged" nodes and exist as soon as you click the "Create" button in the pop-up.  If you don't finish the creation of your new edge any node(s) you created using the pop-up form are ''not'' automatically removed or cleaned up.
** If there is ''not'' already a node like "JohnSmithsCar", select "-create a new node for this object-" from the <tt>Subject</tt> drop-down list, and create a new node using the pop-up form.  When you click the "Create" button in the pop-up, the new node will be immediately added to the wontology (visible to other users) and automatically selected in the <tt>Subject</tt> control.  Any Description text you provided will be shown below.
* Second, choose the edge's predicate using the '''Relates to''' drop-down control.  For this example, we'll create a new [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Property|Property node]] with the Name "isOwnedBy".
** Because node Names must be unique in the wontology, and someone else may be doing the tutorial at the same time you are, if you have any problems you might try a variation on this name, perhaps like "johnsmithproperty_isOwnedBy".  This will make it a little harder to read the new edge/relationship as a sentence, and isn't a good idea for nodes that are expected to become a permanent part of the wontology, but for working through this tutorial it is OK.
** To create the new Property node, select "-create a new property for this relationship-" from the <tt>Relates to</tt> drop-down.  Fill in the pop-up form using "Is owned by" as the Title (remember that Titles don't have to be unique).  This will automatically make the new Name "isOwnedBy".  If the page then says that "isOwnedBy" is not unique, edit it to your own variation.  Fill in anything you want in the Description, and click the "Create" button.
* Third, the edge must have an '''Object''' node.  As previously, we'll use the pop-up node creation form to make a new node for the object as we go.  If you were entering "real" data in a wontology, most or all of the nodes involved in each new edge would already be present in the wontology, because it is common for nodes to be involved in multiple relationships.  For the object, we will create a new node that represents you&mdash;after all, you are the owner of your car.  This time, select "-create a new node for this object-" from the <tt>Object</tt> drop-down.  This will be an [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Individual|Individual]]-type node, because you are an individual, real "thing", not an abstract concept, category, or grouping.  If you type your name like "John Smith" as the Title, the Name will automatically be filled in with "JohnSmith".  (Note that WontoMedia automatically makes the first letter of suggested Names for Properties lower-case, but makes it upper-case for Individual and [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Category|Category]] nodes, following the convention of the [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_OWL|OWL]] standard.)  Complete creating your new node by clicking the "Create" button.
* Now that all three of the new edge's node references have been filled in, the edge itself is made by clicking the "Create" button.

When you click the new edge form's "Create" button, the edge is immediately added to the system, visible to you and others, and its edge information page will be displayed.  From that page, you can edit the edge you just created (change which nodes it references), delete the edge (which you should do if you're done working through tutorials for now), or navigate elsewhere in the system.

If you use a web browser that supports "tabs", there is a trick you can do to clean up the system after this tutorial or any time in the future when you want to get rid of a set of related nodes and edges.  If you've followed along with these instructions, you have created three nodes and end edge in the wontology that don't really belong.  You can't delete the nodes until you have first deleted all of the edges that reference (depend on) them.  But, the easiest way to find the nodes you want to delete is from the links in the edge information page.  In a "tabbed browser", you can start on the edge information page, and open a new tab for each of the three nodes.  In most browsers, this is done by holding down the <tt>Control</tt> or <tt>Command</tt> key while you click on the link.  Once you've made a tab for each of the three nodes, you can click the link delete the edge.  Then, go to each of the tabs in turn, and click the link in those pages to delete the nodes you created during the tutorial.  If you don't want to bother with multiple tabs, you can delete the edge first, and then use a "View all nodes" link to go to the node list page, find the three nodes you've created in the list, and delete them from there.

Now that you can create and delete nodes and edges, you can start building networks of nodes and edges that represent meaningful collections of information.  The next tutorials you should consider are [[WmHelp:Tutorials/CreatingAList|Creating a simple list]] and [[WmHelp:Tutorials/CreatingAHierarchy|Creating a hierarchy]].
