This control allows you to select the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Node node] which will be the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Predicate predicate] of this edge.  The "predicate" is the node which defines the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Relationship relationship] between the edge's subject and object.  For example, in an edge which encapsulates the fact that "the sky is blue", "is" is the predicate.
