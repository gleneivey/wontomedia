This list shows all of the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Edge edges] that reference this [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Node node] as their [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Subject subject].  Each edge references three nodes, which are the edge's subject, [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Predicate predicate], and [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object object].

The edges are represented by a nested list of node [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Title Titles].  At the top of the list, without any indent, is the common subject of all the edges listed (the title of the node this page describes).  Predicates of edges are indented once, and if a node is used as the predicate of several edges, they're grouped together and the node's Title listed only once.  The Titles of nodes referenced as objects are indented twice.  Each edge is represented separately in the list by the Title of its object node, even if the references to its subject and predicate nodes are combined with other nodes.

The Titles of nodes other than this one are links that will show the details page for each corresponding node.  Each edge in the list has a '''Show''' link (to the right of the Title of the edge's object node) that will take you to a page with all of the information about the edge and the nodes it references.  Edges that can be modified also have an '''Edit...''' link to go to the editing page for that edge, and a '''Delete''' link to remove the edge from within this page.
