This text-entry box is used to supply the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Name Name] of the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item item] you are creating.  Names are short (80 characters or less), unique labels for a item.  They should be descriptive but ''must'' be unique across all of the items defined in the wontology.  Because Names are used for interchange with other systems, the characters that can be used are restricted.  A Name must start with a letter (lower or upper case), and can contain only letters, numbers, the underscore character ("_"), and/or the hyphen character ("-").
