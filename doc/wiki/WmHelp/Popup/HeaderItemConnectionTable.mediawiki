This table shows all of the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Edge edges] that reference this [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Node node] as [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Predicate predicate] and/or [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object object].  Each edge is represented by a row of the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Title Titles] of the three nodes that the edge references.  Each edge references three nodes: the edge's [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Subject subject], predicate, and object.

The Titles of nodes other than this one are links that will show the details page for each corresponding node.  Each edge in the list has a '''Show''' link that will take you to a page with all of the information about the edge and the nodes it references.  Edges that can be modified also have an '''Edit...''' link to go to the editing page for that edge, and a '''Delete''' link to remove the edge from within this page.
