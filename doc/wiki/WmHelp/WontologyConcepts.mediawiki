This is a brief summary that relates key concepts within a wontology.  There is a more narrative introduction in the help page describing how [[WmHelp:InformationAsRelationships|information is represented as relationships]], and each term defined below links to that term's entry in our [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO|Glossary]].

* A [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Wontology|wontology]] is made up of [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Node|nodes]] and [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Edge|edges]].
* A node represents something, concrete or abstract, that the wontology describes.
* An edge represents a particular relationship between two nodes, with the type of relationship identified by a third node.

* Each node has a type and several standard text fields
** The text fields include its [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Name|Name]], its [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Title|Title]], and optionally a text [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Description|Description]].
*** A node's Name should be short, and is used to create URLs and other computer-parsed symbols.
*** A node's Title should be a one-line description of what the node represents.
*** A node's (optional) Description is intended to be read by people to understand/maintain the contents of the wontology.
** A node's type can be [[#WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Category|Category]],  [[#WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item|Item]], or [[#WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Property|Property]].
*** Category nodes can contain (in [[#WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Hierarchical|hierarchical]] relationships) Category and/or Item nodes.
*** Item nodes can contain only Item nodes and not Category nodes.
*** Only Property nodes can be referred to as an edge's predicate.

* Each edge references three nodes, a [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Subject|subject]], a [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Predicate|predicate]], and an [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object|object]].
* Two edges in the ontology cannot be identical (that is, refer to exactly the same three nodes in the same order).
* Edges are directional, and always go "from" the subject node "to" the object node.
** Predicate types (represented by Property-type nodes) can be defined so that creating an edge using that predicate ''implies'' a second edge going from the explicit edge's object back to its subject.
** An implied edge cannot be "duplicated" by the explicit creation of an identical edge.

* The meaning of a Property-type node is determined by its relationships to other Property nodes (Properties).
* Property-type nodes can be the subjects and objects of edges just like the other node types can.
* Based on their relationships, some Properties represent [[WmHelp:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Hierarchical|hierarchical relationships]] and some represent [[WmHelp:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Peer|peer relationships]].
** Hierarchical and peer relationships are opposites of each other; a single Property cannot indicate both.
** A relationship need not be either hierarchical or peer.
