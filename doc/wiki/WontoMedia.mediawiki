'''''WontoMedia''''' &mdash; WontoMedia is a web application package
for hosting a Wontology (a
[[Wikipedia:Wiki|Wiki]]-[[Wikipedia:Ontology_(information_science)|Ontology]]):
a classification scheme created and maintained by a community. From
categories in a bug-tracker or RubyForge's "Trove", to a document
repository's controlled vocabulary, a species taxonomy, or
thesaurus. ("''wontology''" comes from '''w'''iki plus
'''ontology'''. "''WontoMedia''" is a '''wonto'''logy web app in the
same way that '''Media'''Wiki is a wiki web app.)

Development of WontoMedia is hosted on
[http://rubyforge.org/projects/wontomedia/ RubyForge], including the
package's [http://wontomedia.rubyforge.org/ main web site], although
not [http://wiki.wontology.org/Main_Page this wiki].

WontoMedia is a free/libre/open-source ([[Wikipedia:FLOSS|FLOSS]])
[http://rubyonrails.org/ Ruby-on-Rails] web application, written in
the language [http://ruby-lang.org/ Ruby]. It is being developed using
FLOSS tools for TDD
([[Wikipedia:Test_driven_development|Test-Driven Development]]) and
[http://testdrivendeveloper.com/2008/04/02/AcceptanceTestDrivenDevelopmentExplained.aspx ATDD]
([http://testobsessed.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/atddexample.pdf Acceptance-Test Driven Development]), and supporting
distribution/installation via
[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/ Git],
[http://www.rubygems.org/ rubygems], and
[http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/upstream-devs.html
tar/setup.rb]. It is intended for websites that are, or that use,
wontologies. That is, websites which are (in whole or in part)
community-produced ontologies, or simpler structures like lists,
hierarchies, taxonomies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies, etc. This
is analogous to how a wiki is used for community production of prose
or to how freebase.com is a "community database" site.
