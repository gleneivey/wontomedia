All [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item|items]] have a text [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Name|Name]] field.  Because the Name is used in web addresses (URLs) and as symbols in files exchanged with other systems, it is limited in length and in the set of characters it can use.  Beyond that, the [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_WontoMedia|WontoMedia]] web application places no limits on how a Name is created.

However, there are standards for [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Ontology|ontologies]] that have conventions for the creation of symbolic identifiers that you may wish to adopt when creating the Names for items in a wontology.  First, because Names are not allowed to contain spaces but will often be composed from multiple words, a solution is needed for making word boundaries within Names more readable.  In programming languages, which have the same problem with the creation of symbolic variable names, there are two common solutions.  First, the spaces can simply be replaced with underscores, which would produce Names that look like "this_is_a_item".  The second common convention is to capitalize the first letter of each word within the Name, like "ThisIsAnotherItem".  In this convention, often called "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case camel case]," there can be arguments over details like what is to be done for single-letter words or acronyms (is the camel case of "I like NASA" really "ILikeNasa"?), and a choice has to be made about the capitalization of the very first letter.

In the [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_RDF|RDF]] and [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_OWL|OWL]] standards, the preferred way to create symbolic names for items is to use camel case.  And further, the standards' authors capitalize names for items that represent things ([[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Category|Category]]- and [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Individual|Individual]]-type items in WontoMedia), use an initial lower-case letter for the names of items used as predicates ([[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Property|Property]]-type items).  It is recommended that, in the absence of a compelling reason, you create item Name strings that conform to this convention.  To make this easy, when creating a new item, WontoMedia automatically creates a suggested Name value (according to this convention) as you type the item's Title.

WontoMedia also contains several [[Help:Built-in Relationship Types|built-in Property-type items]], which can be used either directly as the predicates in the connections you create (if appropriate), or as [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Parent|parents]] of your own Property items.  To distinguish these items from others created in the system, they are named using a convention of underscores in place of spaces, like "sub_property_of".

Finally, note that WontoMedia allows (because URL standards and [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_XML|XML]] both allow) the dash character ("-") to be used in item Name strings.  This would allow the use of a dashes in place of spaces convention, like "this-is-an-item", if desired.  There is no precedent for this in computer programming languages, because there "dash" is typically used to indicate subtraction, and so allowing it in symbol names would be ambiguous.
