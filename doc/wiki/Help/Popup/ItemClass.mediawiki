This control allows you to select the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Class class] of the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item item] you are creating.  The class of an item is represented by a separate connection, of the form "an-item is_instance_of a-class".  When you use a control in an item creation or editing page, it automatically creates, destroys, or modifies the "is_instance_of" connection from an item.

Some classes are associated with a particular item type, and selecting one of those classes for an item will automatically select the item type as well.
