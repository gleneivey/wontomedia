These controls select the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object object] of this [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Connection connection].  Each connection relates two things to each other.  The connection's [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Subject subject] is the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item item] that the connection is "about", the item about which the connection makes a statement.  The [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Predicate predicate] says what ''kind'' of statement is being made, and the object provides the "fact" being asserted about or associated with the subject.

Objects can either be another item in the wontology, or they can be a constant value.  Use the two radio buttons ("Value" or "Item") to select what kind of object this connection will have, and then either type the value in the text box or select an item from the drop-down box.
