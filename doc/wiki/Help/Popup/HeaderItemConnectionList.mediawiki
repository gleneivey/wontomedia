This list shows all of the [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Connection connection] that reference this [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item item] as their [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Subject subject].  Each connection references three items, which are the connection's subject, [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Predicate predicate], and [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object object].

The connections are represented by a nested list of item [http://wiki.wontology.org/wiki/help.php?title=Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Title Titles].  At the top of the list, without any indent, is the common subject of all the connections listed (the title of the item this page describes).  Predicates of connections are indented once, and if an item is used as the predicate of several connections, they're grouped together and the item's Title listed only once.  The Titles of items referenced as objects are indented twice.  Each connection is represented separately in the list by the Title of its object item, even if the references to its subject and predicate items are combined with other items.

The Titles of items other than this one are links that will show the details page for each corresponding item.  Each connection in the list has a '''Show''' link (to the right of the Title of the connection's object item) that will take you to a page with all of the information about the connection and the items it references.  Connections that can be modified also have an '''Edit...''' link to go to the editing page for that connection, and a '''Delete''' link to remove the connection from within this page.
