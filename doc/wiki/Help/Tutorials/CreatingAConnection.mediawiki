Assuming that you [[Help:Tutorials/Creating an Item|know how to create an individual item]], the next most fundamental step in learning how to enter and represent information in a [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Wontology|wontology]] is to be able to create a new [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Connection|connection]] that connects items and represents the [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Relationship|relationship]] they have to each other.

If you are still on the page for the item that was created in the last tutorial, you will find <tt>Add a new connection</tt> in the list of links on the page.  If not, most other pages generated by [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_WontoMedia|WontoMedia]] also contain either that link or a synonymous <tt>Create a new connection</tt> link.

Regardless of the link used, connections are created from the same form page, which contains three drop-down selection controls.  Each control is used to determine one of the three items that the new connection will reference, that is, the new connection's [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Subject|subject]], [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Predicate|predicate]], and [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object|object]].

For example, we will make a statement relating an item that represents an automobile with an item that represents its owner.  For this tutorial, create a connection that expresses the statement "JohnSmithsCar isOwnedBy JohnSmith" (only we'll use item names based on your name rather than the fictitious John Smith).

* First, set the connection's '''Subject''' item to be (your equivalent of) "JohnSmithsCar".  Click on the arrow at the right end of the Subject drop-down select box.
** If you have previously performed the [[Help:Tutorials/Creating an Item|creating an item tutorial]] and did not delete the item that you created then, scroll through the drop-down list (which contains item [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Name|Names]] and [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Title|Titles]]) until you find the item you've previously created, and then select (click on) it.  Once you've selected an item for the Subject, the area below the drop-down control will fill in with the [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Description|Description]] of the item you chose.
** Each of the three drop-down selection controls contains an entry near the top that says "-create a new ___ for this ___-", where the blanks say different things for each of the three different controls.  If you select this entry, a new item creation form will be displayed in a pop-up over the connection creation form.  This form is the same as the one described in the [[Help:Tutorials/Creating an Item|item creation tutorial]], except that it doesn't contain the text that describes the different item types.  Items that you create during connection creation during the pop-up are "full fledged" items and exist as soon as you click the "Create" button in the pop-up.  If you don't finish the creation of your new connection any item(s) you created using the pop-up form are ''not'' automatically removed or cleaned up.
** If there is ''not'' already an item like "JohnSmithsCar", select "-create a new item for this object-" from the <tt>Subject</tt> drop-down list, and create a new item using the pop-up form.  When you click the "Create" button in the pop-up, the new item will be immediately added to the wontology (visible to other users) and automatically selected in the <tt>Subject</tt> control.  Any Description text you provided will be shown below.
* Second, choose the connection's predicate using the '''Relates to''' drop-down control.  For this example, we'll create a new [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Property|Property item]] with the Name "isOwnedBy".
** Because item Names must be unique in the wontology, and someone else may be doing the tutorial at the same time you are, if you have any problems you might try a variation on this name, perhaps like "johnsmithproperty_isOwnedBy".  This will make it a little harder to read the new connection/relationship as a sentence, and isn't a good idea for items that are expected to become a permanent part of the wontology, but for working through this tutorial it is OK.
** To create the new Property item, select "-create a new property for this relationship-" from the <tt>Relates to</tt> drop-down.  Fill in the pop-up form using "Is owned by" as the Title (remember that Titles don't have to be unique).  This will automatically make the new Name "isOwnedBy".  If the page then says that "isOwnedBy" is not unique, edit it to your own variation.  Fill in anything you want in the Description, and click the "Create" button.
* Third, the connection must have an '''Object''' item.  As previously, we'll use the pop-up item creation form to make a new item for the object as we go.  If you were entering "real" data in a wontology, most or all of the items involved in each new connection would already be present in the wontology, because it is common for items to be involved in multiple relationships.  For the object, we will create a new item that represents you&mdash;after all, you are the owner of your car.  This time, select "-create a new item for this object-" from the <tt>Object</tt> drop-down.  This will be an [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Individual|Individual]]-type item, because you are an individual, real "thing", not an abstract concept, category, or grouping.  If you type your name like "John Smith" as the Title, the Name will automatically be filled in with "JohnSmith".  (Note that WontoMedia automatically makes the first letter of suggested Names for Properties lower-case, but makes it upper-case for Individual and [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Category|Category]] items, following the convention of the [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_OWL|OWL]] standard.)  Complete creating your new item by clicking the "Create" button.
* Now that all three of the new connection's item references have been filled in, the connection itself is made by clicking the "Create" button.

When you click the new connection form's "Create" button, the connection is immediately added to the system, visible to you and others, and its connection information page will be displayed.  From that page, you can edit the connection you just created (change which items it references), delete the connection (which you should do if you're done working through tutorials for now), or navigate elsewhere in the system.

If you use a web browser that supports "tabs", there is a trick you can do to clean up the system after this tutorial or any time in the future when you want to get rid of a set of related items and connections.  If you've followed along with these instructions, you have created three items and end connection in the wontology that don't really belong.  You can't delete the items until you have first deleted all of the connections that reference (depend on) them.  But, the easiest way to find the items you want to delete is from the links in the connection information page.  In a "tabbed browser", you can start on the connection information page, and open a new tab for each of the three items.  In most browsers, this is done by holding down the <tt>Control</tt> or <tt>Command</tt> key while you click on the link.  Once you've made a tab for each of the three items, you can click the link delete the connection.  Then, go to each of the tabs in turn, and click the link in those pages to delete the items you created during the tutorial.  If you don't want to bother with multiple tabs, you can delete the connection first, and then use a "View all items" link to go to the item list page, find the three items you've created in the list, and delete them from there.

Now that you can create and delete items and connections, you can start building networks of items and connections that represent meaningful collections of information.  The next tutorials you should consider are [[Help:Tutorials/Creating a List|Creating a simple list]] and [[Help:Tutorials/Creating a Hierarchy|Creating a hierarchy]].
