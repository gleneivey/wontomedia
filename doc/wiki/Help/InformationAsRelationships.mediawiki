[[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Ontology|Ontologies]], like the one stored at this web site, are structured representations of information.  Unlike more limited structures like database tables, an ontology is composed of a set of relationships between things.  The things described by an ontology are represented by "[[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Item|items]]" and the relationships between them are represented by "[[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Connection|connections]]."

[[File:InformationAsRelationships-ItemConnectionItem.png|center]]

Each individual relationship (connection) expresses a single "fact" or statement, and consists of three parts: a [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Subject|subject]], a [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Predicate|predicate]], and an [[Help:GlossaryAtoO#anchor_Object|object]].  Each relationship makes a simple statement, like "white is-a color".  In this example, "white" is the subject of the relationship, "is-a" is the predicate (the verb; the type of relationship), and "color" is the object.

Each [[Help:GlossaryPtoZ#anchor_Relationship|relationship]] "triple" references three items, and connects a subject to an object.  The middle item referenced by an connection, the connection's predicate, determines the type of relationship the connection ''asserts'' that the subject and object items have with each other.  So, not only are the things that an ontology describes represented by items, but the ''kinds'' of statements an ontology can make about those things are also represented by items within the ontology itself.  That is one of the powerful things about ontologies versus other information representations:  the meanings and statements that can be made can be extended and refined indefinitely.

An item is any named entity in an ontology.  Items can represent abstract concepts or specific entities in the real world.  The same item will usually be part of several relationships (will be referenced by multiple connections), so that the entire content of a wontology forms a network of entities (items) connected by relationships (connections).  Each connection is a separate individual and stands alone:

but the ontology as a whole is the composite of all the connections it contains:

[[File:InformationAsRelationships-NetworkMerged.png|center]]

Note that each relationship has a direction (one end is the subject item, and the other is the object item, and not the reverse).  For this reason, the entire network of items and connections makes up what's known as a "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph directed graph]."  In the terminology of directed graphs, things (which are "nodes" in graph theory and Items in a wontology) are linked to each other by arrows ("edges" in graph theory, Connections in a wontology).

The information in an ontology can be "shaped like" any simpler information categorization scheme:

[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-List.png]]
[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-Hierarchy.png]]
[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-OrgChart.png]]
[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-FamilyTree.png]]
[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-Table.png]]
[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-Peer.png]]
[[File:InformationAsRelationships-Shape-Thesaurus.png]]

The first example is a simple list.  The next three examples are all hierarchies.  The first hierarchy, involving items descended from "Vehicle" is the same as the previous example, it simply looks more like a hierarchy in this case then before because of its layout.  The organization chart and family tree are both arranged like hierarchies, but actually contain both hierarchical relationships ("worksFor" and "childOf") and peer relationships ("worksWith" and "marriedTo").  The last examples show arrangements where peer relationships dominate, with the final example being a ''fragment'' of a thesaurus&mdash;the complete set of relationships for just one item.
