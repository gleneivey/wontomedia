'''''GitHub''''' (https://github.com/) is a website that provides network-based repositories that can be accessed using the [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/ Git] revision-control tool.

The central web page for our primary repository on GitHub is at:

 https://github.com/gleneivey/wontomedia

If you are a GitHub user, this is the preferred repository for you to clone from.  Pull requests can be made to this repository, and your changes will be integrated and tested from GitHub, then pushed to the repository on [[RubyForge]].

These are the URLs for use to do a <tt>Git-clone</tt> to your local development system.  The first if you are doing an "anonymous" public clone, and the second if you are committer (a "collaborator" on GitHub).
