      <p>

Sorry, but we have been having problems with a spammer defacing
articles and replacing user content with questionable links.  To
protect our visitors from links to uncertain content and our
contributors from having their content lost (being defaced prior to
being backed-up the first time),

<span style='color: black; font-family: Monotype Corsiva, Apple Chancery, URW Chancery L, chancery, script, cursive; font-style: italic; font-size: 130%;'>Ada<span style='color: #b0b0ff;'>'</span>s Daughters</span>

will be down indefinitely until a technical solution can be arranged.

      </p><p>

If you were looking for a particular notable woman's page, you should
be able to find the original content by doing a Google search for your
subject and including <code>site:adasdaughters.org allintitle:</code> in the
search terms, and then using Google's <code>Cached</code> link to
fetch their archived copy of our page.  Sorry again for any inconvenience.
