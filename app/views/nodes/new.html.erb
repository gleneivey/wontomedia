    <dl><dt>Category</dt><dd>

      "Category" is for groups of things, for concepts, and for the
      upper levels of hierarchies.  (Though a hierarchy made up entirely
      of concepts could be all Categories.)  Categories can "contain"
      other categories or items.

    </dd><dt>Item</dt><dd>

      "Item" is for individual, concrete things.  Items can "contain"
      other items, but cannot contain categories.  ("Ford Model-T" might
      be an item, but could still contain parts that are also items,
      like "Windshield" and "Tire".)
